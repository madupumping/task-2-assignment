Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
Difference between git and github is that git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code while gitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories.
3 other github alternatives are 1.Git Lab 2.Bitbucket 3.OneDev
The key difference between git fetch and pull is that git pull copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, while git fetch does not. The git fetch command only copies changes into your local Git repo.
A Git rebase changes the base of the developer's branch from one commit to another, so it looks like they have created their branch from a different commit. Internally, Git creates a new commit and applies it to the specified base. The command for it is "git rebase --"
git cherry-pick in git means choosing a commit from one branch and applying it to another branch. The command for it is "git cherry-pick --"
